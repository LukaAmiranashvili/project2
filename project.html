    <p>Why it's good for the environment?</p>
</h2>

<h2>
    <p>The ants are very good for our enviroment.Ants play an important role in the environment. Ants turn and aerate the soil, allowing water and oxygen to reach plant roots. Ants take seeds down into their tunnel to eat the nutritious elaiosomes that are part of the seed. These seeds often sprout and grow new plants (seed dispersal). </p>
